How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing the code changes helps focus on areas that affect the program

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see the changes over time and view a larger picture.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Git allows more control over what to commit while Google Docs doesn't.
    Git does not have automatic saves like Google Docs

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows multiple files that affect each other to be saved in a repository.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use git log to see the changes that contains commit IDs. Use git diff
    using commit IDs to compare changes between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing exactly where something went wrong helps in managing large projects

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
